# Python Programming Internship

## Overview

Welcome to my CodSoft Python Programming Internship! This README is dedicated to sharing my journey during this internship and providing essential information about my experience as a Python programming intern at CodSoft.

## About the Internship

I'm thrilled to be part of CodSoft's Python Programming Internship, a four-week program that began on September 25, 2023, and is set to wrap up on October 25, 2023. This internship offers an incredible educational opportunity, with a strong emphasis on Python programming, skill enhancement, and practical hands-on experience.

## My Goals

As an intern, my primary goals during this internship are:

- **Python Learning**: I aim to deepen my knowledge of Python, exploring its advanced concepts and practical applications.
- **Skill Enhancement**: My goal is to enhance my Python programming skills and be well-prepared for a career in Python development.

## Responsibilities And Tasks

I'm committed to giving my best to all tasks and projects assigned to me which are as under: 
<br>
- **Task 1**: A to-do list application serves as a practical tool for users, enabling them to effectively manage and structure their tasks. This project is dedicated to empowering users to generate, modify, and monitor their to-do lists, thereby facilitating better organization and task management.
- **Task 2**: Using Python, design a straightforward calculator that supports fundamental arithmetic operations. Prompt the user to input two numbers and their choice of operation, perform the calculation, and finally, display the result.
- **Task 3**: A password generator serves as a valuable tool, generating random and secure strong password for users. This project is dedicated to developing a password generator application in Python. It empowers users to specify the desired password length and complexity, enabling the creation of strong and customizable passwords.
- **Task 4**: Designing a Rock-Paper-Scissors using python. It can serve as a foundation for more complex game development projects, allowing us to build on this basic structure and add new features and complexities.
- **Task 5**: Designing contact book stores store names, phone numbers, emails, and addresses. Users can add, view, search, update, and delete contacts with a user-friendly interface.
